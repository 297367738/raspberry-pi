You should download the TensorFlow Inception model and extract the package to any directory. NOTE that the model url link may change over time, so the following commands are not guaranteed to be correct.

```Bash
mkdir ~/raspberry-pi/ai/tensorflow-related/resource/model
cd ~/raspberry-pi/ai/tensorflow-related/resource/model
wget http://download.tensorflow.org/models/image/imagenet/inception-2015-12-05.tgz
tar xf inception-2015-12-05.tgz
```
